# ADT Stack Postfix Converter

This project implements a stack interface and stack class to handle operators of the infix expressions. Infix expressions are loaded from a string array. It does not currently allow the user to enter
infix expressions. The program outputs the current infix expression being converted and the resulting postfix expression.

Note: The user may view the progression of the infix and postfix expressions during conversion by uncommenting the print lines in the convertToPostfix method.

# What I Learned

* Created an ADT stack using a stack class that implements a stack interface.
* Converted infix expressions to postfix expressions.
